Names are generated by trainning Markov Chain model on the list of sample names.
For example, if we want a name which will sound like English city name, then train this model using
list of english city names. 

Because of this, the generator is very flexible and can be used to generate names in different styles.
Just provide it some examples. The more the better


## Usage

Add dependency to your project
```
