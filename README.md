Generate procedural names using Markov Chain. [Try it in the browser](https://klangner.github.io/namegen.rs/) using WebAssembly.


## Introduction

Names are generated by Markov Chain train on the list ofsample names.
For example: If we want a name which will sound like English city name, then train this model using
list of english city names. 

Because of this this generator is very flexible and can be used to generate names in different styles.
Just provide it some examples in the desired style.


## Usage

Add dependency to your project
```
namegen = "0.1"
```

Using generator:

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;
```
